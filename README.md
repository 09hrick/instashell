Instashell is an Shell Script to perform brute force attack against Instagram, this script can bypass login limiting on wrong passwords, so basically it can test infinite number of passwords.

### Usage:
```
git clone https://github.com/thelinuxchoice/instashell
cd instashell
chmod +x instashell.sh
sudo ./instashell.sh
```

### How it works?

Script uses an Android ApkSignature to perform authentication in addition using TOR to change the ip address once blocked for many tries and continue attack.
